Managing access rights and user accounts becomes increasingly easier with the AFAS Profit connector. The AFAS HelloID integration allows for the automation of these processes based on the HR system. In this article, I provide more explanation about what this integration entails and the specific possibilities it offers.

## What is AFAS Profit
AFAS is a comprehensive HRM, payroll, and financial management software solution. It streamlines the management of employee information, contract details, and organisational data to improve efficiency and effectiveness within an organisation.

## Why is an AFAS Profit integration useful?

Managing user accounts and access rights can be time-consuming and prone to error, especially when manual processes are involved. It's essential to ensure that new employees have the correct authorisation from day one so they can start working immediately. Moreover, it's important that changes in roles, locations, or employment status are accurately reflected in the system. The AFAS HelloID integration enables the automation of these processes based on the HR system. Additionally, the AFAS connector offers integration with common target systems such as:

* Active Directory
* Azure AD
* TOPdesk

Further details about the integration with these target systems can be found later in the article.

## The HelloID AFAS Integration Helps You With
ðŸ‘‰ **Accelerated account creation:** Automated processes speed up the time needed to create new accounts. New employees can be productive from day one, with minimal manual intervention.

ðŸ‘‰ **Error-free account management:** Automated processes reduce the chance of errors in account management. Employees always have exactly the accounts and rights they are entitled to according to the authorisation matrix.

ðŸ‘‰ **Bi-directional synchronisation:** Changes in AFAS Profit are automatically detected and processed in all systems and applications linked to HelloID. Usernames and email addresses generated by HelloID are also automatically written back to AFAS.

ðŸ‘‰ **Improved service levels and security:** Integration of AFAS with HelloID helps organisations meet service level agreements (SLA) and pass IT audits.

## How HelloID Integrates with AFAS
As a Certified Partner of AFAS, Tools4ever has a certified integration with both AFAS Profit and AFAS Online. AFAS can be integrated with HelloID as both source and target connector. Thanks to the integration, HelloID detects any change in AFAS and automatically manages user accounts in the application landscape according to defined rules and procedures.

HelloID supports various identity life cycle processes, including creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts based on information in AFAS. The table below lists some examples of common changes that can occur in AFAS and the associated procedures.

| Change in AFAS                           | Procedure in Target Systems |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **New employee**                         | Based on information in AFAS, a user account is created in linked applications with the correct group memberships. Depending on the role of the new employee, user accounts are created and rights assigned in other systems. |
| **Employee changes position**            | User accounts receive different rights in linked systems. The authorisation model in HelloID is automatically consulted, and rights are added and removed. |
| **Employee gets married/divorced**       | The display name and email address are adjusted (if desired). |
| **Employee changes location**            | User account is moved to another OU in AD and provided with location-specific rights. |
| **Employee leaves the company**          | User accounts are deactivated, and involved employees in the organisation are informed. After a period, the accounts are automatically deleted. |

The certified AFAS connector seamlessly exchanges data between AFAS and HelloID, such as personnel data, contract information, and organisational data. The app-connector system of AFAS enables connection between both systems using Get and Update Connectors.

The Get Connector retrieves data from AFAS and shares it with HelloID. This connector **allows custom views of AFAS data by creating a dataset based on fields.** Get Connectors are available at the environment level and can be exchanged between environments with import and export functions. A standard Get Connector is available for HelloID integration, which can be easily loaded.

The Update Connector enables HelloID to **add, modify, or delete data in the AFAS database. For example, HelloID can update employee email addresses and manage user accounts within AFAS Insite.

## Linking AFAS with Active Directory, Azure, TOPdesk, and More
HelloID makes it easy to link AFAS with common target systems. This ensures improved automation and collaboration between different applications. Some relevant examples of integrations include:
* **AFAS â€“ Active Directory integration**
Experience seamless synchronisation between AFAS and Active Directory (AD) with HelloID, keeping accounts and access rights up to date at all times.
* **AFAS â€“ Azure AD integration**
Benefit from automated synchronisation between AFAS and Azure AD with HelloID. Based on AFAS, HelloID ensures automatic account creation, rights management, and license management (e.g., Office licenses).
* **AFAS â€“ TOPdesk integration**
Increase efficiency between HR and IT by linking AFAS with TOPdesk. HelloID can, for example, automatically create tickets during onboarding, leading to a streamlined process.

In addition, HelloID supports more than 200 connectors, offering an extensive range of integration possibilities between AFAS and other systems.
